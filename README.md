# Padlock Encryption Software

Padlock is a 3 in 1 encryption software that has a wonderful designed GUI which gives access to a number of standard encryption ciphers.

Padlock includes:
- Caesar Cipher
- Vigenere cipher
- DES
- Triple DES
- AES
- RC4

Not only does the software allow users to encrypt and decrypt their messages, it also has support for files and images. Images will be saved in their encrypted form and when opened, the pixels would have changed.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install to get the software running
 
```
You will need the latest version of Python installed on your machine.

The image encryption uses the Python Image Library, so you will need to install this as well.
```

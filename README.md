# Padlock Encryption Software

Padlock is a 3 in 1 encryption software that aims to teach students cryptography through a wonderful designed GUI that gives access to a number of standart encryption methods.

It teaches students ciphers with different levels of security, from Caesar Cipher to DES Cipher. Not only does the software allow the students to encrypt and decrypt their messages, it also allows them to visualise the strength of the ciphers through image encryption and decryption! The software also has support for file encyption/decryption as well.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install to get the software running
